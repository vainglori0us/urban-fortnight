            <div class="kg-card-markdown"><p>So I finally listened to More Life. No, <em>really</em> listened. Played it straight through from 1 to 22. No skipping around the album or around the tracks. I also tried to contain other activity to a minimum so I could really focus on the music.<br>
I didn't like it. 2/5 at the absolute max. I mean I love Drake. My wife calls Drake my Patron Saint. It's that serious. But I don't feel the same here. It doesn't give me that So Far Gone, Thank Me Later vibe. Don't get me wrong. He's still himself. He's gonna give you the lines that make you say "damn that ni**a cold" and he's gonna give you the tracks that bump or make you reminisce. That's just his steez. And I know that it's labeled as a "playlist" but More Life was an utter disappointment for fans like me who were hoping for more of a Take Care 2.0 versus Views or IYRTITL 2.0 (that's "If You're Reading This It's Too Late," for the uninitiated). And that's fine I guess. Drake gets paid regardless. I was just hoping for more Drake from More Life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When that one bar hits you right in the feels</p>

<p>And I know that people say there are a lot of Jamaicans and West Indians in Toronto but that doesn't make Drake Jamaican. The same way a white person with a lot of black friends can't be black. Ever. The culture vulture shit is wack to me. It would be different if... Well, if a lot of things. If the music was good, if he did the accent well, if he had a song or two (instead of half an album) paying homage and acknowledging the Jamaican artists that inspire him but it just comes off gimmicky. The fact that there were Jamaican and British artists on the album doesn't go unnoticed by me. But rapping about your Jamaican friends in a poor accent and letting them and your British buds hop on the track ain't the same as paying homage. At all.<br>
I don't want to hear a dancehall beat every other song. I get that he's an artist but straight ripping other people's culture for personal/commercial gain does not constitute art as far as I'm concerned.</p>
<p>Again, I love Drake. I love the punchlines and the mixture of sadboi kinda-singing R&amp;B (who hurt you?); slow-going introspective lines and hard witty bars that body ni**as. But I didn't really get that on More Life. I want to hear from that Drake on the next release.</p>
<p>People don't understand my attachment to "that" Drake. But we close in age. I feel like I grew up with that ni**a lowkey. I was newly 19 when So Far Gone came out and there was nothing else like it in mainstream consciousness to the best of my recollection. Dudes were calling him p***y and just going on my man literally for being human and expressing his humanity on wax. But I fucked with it so heavy. He was a regular dude with both feelings of insecurity and feelings of being the shit; failure and triumphs and plain old tries. And he had bars about it. I used to listen to Houstatlantavegas when I was first learning to drive and I would go see my then girlfriend (now wife) on late nights. The straight up vibes on that joint helped me remain calm, even when I was sure I had no idea where I was going. I went the wrong way down a highway ramp one time and had to promptly turn my ass back around.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I apologize to everybody that shared the road with me back then</p>

<p>That same year, I started my first "real job" selling TVs and computers (mostly laptops) as well as accessories and addons for TVs and computers for a big box store. Some wild stuff happened at my mom's that turned the household upside down and I moved in with my girl and took my half brother and half sister (we share a father and they share both parents) with me. In 2010, when Thank Me Later dropped, I was regularly commuting between work and my new home and it was heat. I have never forgotten the way I felt listening to it the first couple times on my way home.</p>
<p>My dad died early 2011. I got super depressed and stopped going to the job that I hated by that time. They terminated me. That's ok. I'll get another, I told myself. My lady and I started looking for somewhere else to stay because it was pretty cramped in that one bedroom apartment with 2 extra bodies.</p>

<p>When I got that message...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the time Take Care was coming out, we were getting ready to close on a house and... I was a straight up stan. Other people had come around, too. When Marvin's Room came out it was a wrap. Then Headlines and Make Me Proud. Smash after smash after smash. Drake had 2011-2012 locked down harder than a prison riot. He exploded that year. And I was ecstatic about all the fire music he put out. I played Headlines to the point that I still know the words after not hearing it for at least 2 years and even so, I probably couldn't stand to listen to it at this point because I'm just that fatigued.</p>
<p>Late 2012, I got a call from a gentleman asking me if I was still on the market and still interested in a job that I applied to months earlier. I wanted to say, "hell yeah!" because I hadn't worked since my dad died, despite applying like crazy on a daily basis but I said "yes, sir, when can I start?" I had to pass a moderately difficult interview and get the usual work-up; drug test, background check and fingerprints. I would officially be on the rolls January 2013.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When can I start? Yesterday? Lemme get in my DeLorean. Brb</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing Was The Same came out in September but my new schedule kept me from getting a chance to listen to it. The job ended up sending me to some paid training out of state; my first flight in a long time.<br>
I loaded up NWTS on my iPhone 4, made sure I packed my headphones and went on my way. I got settled in my exit row window seat, put my headphones in and just listened from start to finish. Twice, I think. Then I just sat with it. It was a total departure from Take Care, but it grew on me. The samples, the overall production of it. How some songs blended into each other. It was great.</p>
<p>IYRTITL came out as I was becoming intensely disillusioned with my job at the time. But I had my work ni**as and I made the best of it that I could. I would give my homies rides home bumping Legend, Preach, Energy and on and on. I know they got tired of it. It was even more of a departure in some ways but it still was kind of a banger in other ways so I let it rock, accepting it for what it was. What a Time To Be Alive came out the following September and I think I had all but given up on "old" Drake. I was still interested to see what he put out and hype about the release. WATTBA didn't disappoint. The energy was high and the tracks hit hard. From production to delivery it seemed like a win to me, as far as the new style goes. 30 for 30 felt like "home" but it definitely didn't match the energy of the rest of the project. Gave me hope though.</p>
<p>2016 brought Views and happily trounced that hope, with too many forgettable tracks, lyrics that too often either fell flat or felt empty, too much dancehall for a non-Jamaican artist and a lot of 80s and early 90s production influences that appear random as far as selection and placement, so the record as a whole comes off as lacking in cohesion, direction and fire. The dancehall joints bump, of course, but that's because dancehall is dance music. I don't much attribute it to having made good music on Drake's part. A couple stand outs to me were 9, Redemption stuck with me, Weston Road Flows, Still Here and Fire &amp; Desire. I know that sounds like a lot but 5 songs off a 20 song project? Eh.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How I feel about "Views"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which brings us back to More Life. Y'all already know how I feel about that.</p>
<p>And here's the thing. I didn't completely hate it. It's just not the greatness I was expecting. A couple things that stood out were on Jorja Interlude where he reused (or maybe resampled) Stevie Wonder's sax solo. 4422 is smooth thanks to Sampha. Gyalchester a legit bop. Like uncontested summer jam type shit. Portland is a popular single but I ain't feeling it. I listen to it because it's familiar from the radio playing it back to back but when I sit with it, it's not a song I pick out to listen to for personal enjoyment. It's background music. Teenage Fever straight; the sample and the heavy-lidded pace make it easy listening. Lose You aight, Can't Have Everything started out well but the syncopated flow was a little <em>too</em> off. Glow was straight. Since Way Back was aight even though it's kinda long; that's to be expected with the song taking it pretty slow. Ice Melts had some weird parts lyrically and in the ad libs but it was straight. DND is your typical "Drake's journal" type track. I can dig it. Needless to say, the second half of the album was way better than the first half for me. Considering it's 22 tracks long and nearly an hour and a half lengthwise, that's one hell of a build up. And the payoff is meager if I'm completely honest. Still, it's a decent album by today's standards.</p>
<p>But I went on a tangent there. This isn't a Drake or More Life review.</p>
<p>My point is... I feel like we've grown apart. On the one hand, I get it. Once you get to be so big a personality, you gotta "turn it on" regardless and give the people what they want so you can make your money. On the other hand, I think some people still want (and will pay for) good music and expect better. I know I do.</p>
<p>The Ja-fakin' shit corny regardless. But here's to Drake. The good, bad and ugly. To my own surprise, I'm quite curious what the next project will sound like. I got my fingers crossed for a dancehall-free release. And here's to me. I set out on a journey to be an adult almost 10 years ago, having no idea where it would lead or what was entailed. I've been through it all. And, even though all signs point to more of the same--as with Drake--I'm still intrigued and excited to see what lies ahead.</p>
