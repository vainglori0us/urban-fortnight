        <section class="post-content">
            <div class="kg-card-markdown"><p>When you begin studying a new craft that you want to practice, it can be hard to distinguish between the tools you need to get the job done and "convenience" tools that are used make your life easier. It's something I definitely struggled with as a new producer so I want to put this out there for producers that will be new after me.<br>
I have no doubt you have heard the quote, "The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." I actually may have paraphrased a little but my point is, you have to start. You can't start the journey if you want to finish another mixing article, top 10 [insert item] list or watch one more tutorial on something you haven't even tried yet. You also can't start if you're trying to save up for that new piece of gear with the amazing tech that you've been following the development of for months now.<br>
And even seasoned craftspeople that don't have everything they'd like to have sometimes need reminders, too.</p>
<p>Tell me if you've seen this before on Snapchat, Instagram, YouTube or wherever you do your social media thing:<br>
Studio monitors - $700<br>
Video monitor(s) - $200+<br>
MIDI Keyboard - $150<br>
Monitor stands - $75<br>
Audio Interface - $300<br>
Desk - $100</p>
<p>Generalization: Pros use outboard gear and other hardware.</p>
<p>Many pros have (or use at their studio) hardware compressors and reverbs, large format consoles and all manner of cool looking gadget; none of which is needed to start. And the keyword there is start. Based on my research and personal experience, the reasons for outboard gear can be condensed to really 4 main things:</p>
<ul>
<li>familiarity</li>
<li>workflow enhancement/save time</li>
<li>pleasure</li>
<li>specialty (getting that "certain sound" or "x factor")</li>
</ul>
<p>None of that is necessary to begin. Literally. All you truly need is the software (DAW) and a way to hear what you're making. Now you might be thinking how to pick a DAW or which DAW is best. Before you Google that, let me save you some time here: there is no perfect DAW. There's no best DAW. There's no DAW with "the best" sound. There's only the right tool at the right time. What's perfect for you now may not be a fit down the line or may not work for you for a given task.</p>
<p>Personally I use Ableton. I love it and I do everything in it, but I've had to realize that it does have its shortcomings. While it's great for sketching and composition there are DAWs that do a better job with vocal comping and mixing, for example.</p>
<p>So, what's the answer then? What do you need to start? You need patience, resolve and creativity. Decide what you're creating and pick a DAW. Then pick another if you need to; I'm not judging. Find your fit. Discover how you like to work and find the program that offers you the least resistance.</p>
<p>I think about it two ways: you have more time than you have money or you have more money than you have time. If you have more time than money then you should take the time to learn your DAW because it can do nearly anything that can be accomplished with hardware. If you have more money than time then get one or two things that will improve your workflow or efficiency. This might come in the form of improved sound via studio monitors or improved ergonomics in your studio or pretty much anything you can think of that will increase productivity.</p>
<p>Either way, the gear doesn't make the music. You do. Tools are just tools at the end of the day. They're instruments for doing your work. Don't get lost in response curves and specs on rack mount reverbs and other wild internet rabbit holes. Whatever you pick, however you decide to configure things, the sounds that come out of it all come down to you creating and shaping them.</p>
<p>Make the music.</p>
